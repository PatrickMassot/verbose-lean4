# Verbose Lean 4

This project provides tactics and commands for
[Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) in a very controlled
natural language. The original version of those tactics were written in
French for teaching purposes at 
[Universit√© Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) in
Orsay using Lean 3. The goal is not to make Lean code easier to write, the goal is to
make Lean code easier to transfer to a traditional paper proof.

The best way to have a quick look is to read the examples file
in [English](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/verbose-lean4/blob/master/Verbose/English/Examples.lean) or 
[French](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/verbose-lean4/blob/master/Verbose/French/Examples.lean),
although GitHub obviously misses proper syntax highlighting here. 

There is also a point-and-click interface for courses with a low time budget. One can see it in the following animated gif.

You can read [a paper](itp2024_paper.pdf) written about this library for 
[ITP2024](https://www.viam.science.tsu.ge/itp2024/).

If you want to try it or start writing your exercises using it then you
should read [getting-started.md](getting-started.md). Then you can tweak the
behavior of tactics using the [basic configuration guide](basic-configuration.md).
For information about translating those tactics to your language, see the
[translation guide](translations.md).

You can find a very simple example of a library importing Verbose at
[verbose-lean-demo](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/verbose-lean-demo).
You can find a full set of exercises in the [proofs with Lean](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/proofs_with_lean) repository. If you are a teacher then you can ask me for the solutions to those exercises. The French version is in the [MDD154](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/MDD154/) repository.

If you simply want to play a bit with the example shown in the picture above
then you can 
[![Open the project in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/new/#https://github.com/patrickmassot/verbose-lean4) 
and use the file explorer to open the file `Verbose/English/Examples.lean`.

If you use those tactics for teaching, I'd be very interested to hear about it, and would gladly add your name and the name of your university in this file.
